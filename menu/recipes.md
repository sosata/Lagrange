### Eggplant Stew (Kashk o Bademjan)

I have made this dish a few times for people from around the globe, and everyone has loved it!

Here's what you need:

- 3 large eggplants
- 1 cup walnut pieces
- 1/2 large onion
- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 table spoon dried mint
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 3 table spoons neutral oil (canola, subflower, etc)
- Salt and pepper
- (Optional) Tiny amount of Saffron
- (Optional) A handful of fresh mint leaves

Preparation:

- Peel eggplants, cut them along in half, and add a bit of salt all around. Leave eggplants like this while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
- Chop the onion in small pieces.
- Chop the garlic cloves in tiny pieces, or (better) mince them.
- Crush walnuts using a grinder or mortar and pestle,  but not too much.

Cooking:

- (Pan 1) Heat two table spoons of oil and add chopped onions. Fry onions on medium heat until they are light and golden (~20-30min). Add minced garlic and dried mint to onons, and fry for another 2-3 min. Turn the heat off.
- (Pan 2) While Pan 1 is cooking, in a separate pan add the eggplant pieces with 1/2 cup watter and 1/2 table spoon of oil. Cover and cook on medium-high heat. You need to frequently check this pan. Flip the eggplants, and add more water if water in the pan has evaporated. Continue cooking until eggplants become tenter and "smashable" (~ 30 min).
- Smash the eggplants in Pan 2, and then add chopped walnuts, content of Pan 1, and two cups of water to it. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 30 min. Add sour cream and continue cooking for another 15-30 min. Stir occaisionally, and add more water if necessary.
- (Optional) Grind saffron using mortar and pestle, and add 1/4 cup hot water to it. Cover and let it brew for 10 min. Add brewed saffron to the stew during the last 5 minutes of cooking. 
- Garnish with fresh mint leaves, and serve with fresh bread.
